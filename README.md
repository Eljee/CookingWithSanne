# CookingWithSanne
Cooking With Sanne is a learning project. The main goal is learning how to use Django to make web interfaces for a wide range of pyhton-based tools.

Inception
=========
The idea for Cooking With Sanne (which started as Koken met Sanne, in dutch) started with cooking at home and having to find the recipes we used to love online. Again and again looking which of the 1M recipes you wanted to used was becomming a pain. Therefore, making a nice database of Sanne's favorite recipes became the goal. Soon though, we found that no recipe we used was really what we found online. Either because we changed it to our taste or because we made variations to keep it fresh and interesting. This then, was a new focal point for Cooking With Sanne! Appart from having a standard feature set (see below for a list), like every mundane recipe website, Cooking With Sanne will have the option to see all variations on a recipe. Appart from having the opportunity of keep your favorite food from becoming commonplace, you will be able to master the recipes by cooking them, over and over!

Feature Set
===========
Even before starting the project coding, set of features that need to be added will be described. Note that this is done because the way the Models in the Django Framework interact. Within my knowledge now, all models that have some interaction (i.e. a ForeignKey) will need to be linked before the database structure can be made.
